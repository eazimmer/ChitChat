# ChitChat
A Kotlin-based Android app acting as a client to a simple social network called Chit Chat. Final project for CSI-319 completed in Fall 2020.

The client supports a chronologically sorted stream of text messages from its users. Each displayed message will contain the message's posting timestamp, 
the message content, the author, and the number of likes and dislikes the message has received. Data will be sent and received to and from a supporting server hosted by 
Champlain College.
